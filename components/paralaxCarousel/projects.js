    title: "Virtual Wallet",
    description: `In the "Virtual Wallet" project, I served as a full-stack developer and, together with a team, we created a virtual wallet from scratch. Specifically, I created the database in a Docker container with MySQL, using Sequelize as ORM with migrations and seeds. Additionally, I developed the authentication system using JWT and password hashing with Bcrypt. To ensure the security and efficiency of the website, I implemented middlewares for error handling and authentication. I also developed some of the routes and controllers in the BackEnd, and the forms in the FrontEnd to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience.`,
